## Objectives

The objective of this training is to learn:

* Why this topic is relevant.
* What you want to know first.
* About the lab environment, what's available to me?
* Basic conceptual knowledge about the topic, such as authentication needed.
* Advanced information about the topic, such as specific configuration or security considerations.
* What are practical applications for this topic?

## Prerequisites

Use bullet points or sub headings to list any prerequisites, such as tools that need to be installed or other labs that should be completed before starting this lab.

## More reasons to learn this topic

You can set more context here. The idea for this template is that you can teach people in a classroom based on the text and images on each page, as if it were a slide deck.

### Images

Use the following markdown syntax to add an image:

> `![](/posts/files/lab-dir-and-id/assets/images/image_filename.png)`

where `lab-dir-and-id` is the name of the directory containing the subdirectory assets/images.

For example, here is a test.png image:

![](/posts/files/basic-template/assets/images/test_image.png)

The publishing engine requires `/posts/files` in the path in order to parse the assets and images.

> NOTE: Due to the paths, you cannot display the image in your markdown editor nor in Github. View the image placement and accuracy in the Learning Lab Previewer tool, and the [Production](https://learninglabs.cisco.com) site where we publish the labs for public use and the [Staging](https:learninglabs.cisco.com:8867) site for internal Cisco use.
