## Step 6. Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool on Windows


This step provides guidelines to install the Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) tool into a Windows Operating System. These instructions were written using Windows 7.  If you are using a Linux environment skip this step and go to Step 7.  If you are having trouble with installing the LLP on your OS, there is a workaround provided in Step 8 with Docker.

The [Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) tool](https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse) displays how the lab content will appear on the production website. You can install this tool directly onto your computer.  The steps below will show how to download and install the LLP tool into a Windows OS.

### Downloading the Learning Lab Previewer
1. On your workstation create a directory for which you will install the LLP, then access the directory
   *  cd \
   * mkdir llp
   * cd \llp

2. Access the public repository https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse by entering the URL into your browser.  There is no need to log into Bitbucket to access the repository

3. In the web browser screen there are two action links located in the left navigation panel.  Click on the **Download** link.  A pop up window will appear.  Save the zipped file into your `llp` directory.

  * If you receive an SSL error during the installation this error is a known issue with Ruby.  There are several solutions to work around this issue such as [create a certificate](https://superdevresources.com/ssl-error-ruby-gems-windows/) which was utilized by our team, or temporarily [using http instead of https](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1736)
  ```
  ERROR: Could not find a valid gem 'compass' (>= 0), here is why:
    Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/
      - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B:
      certificate verify failed
```
8. In the /llp directory edit the `config.json` file and specify the path where the labs to be reviewed are placed.
  * For example, the author's entry is: {
 "labPath": "/users/brtiller/dev/devnet-learning-labs/devnet-guidelines/labs"}
9. On the command window access the llp directory and type `grunt serve`.  The following detail should appear.

  * A browser window will open with contents displaying the labs under the specified directory that may be reviewed:
