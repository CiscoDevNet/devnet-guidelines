## Step 6. Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool on Windows 7 Platforms

Markdown previewers vary in their rendering capabilities as well as in their interpretations of various flavors of Markdown. To preview your lab content as it will appear on the DevNet site, you must install the __Learning Lab Previewer (LLP)__ tool on your computer.  To download and install the LLP tool on a Windows 7 platform, follow these instructions. If you are not using a Windows 7 machine to write your lab content, see the following:

* [Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool on Linux]()
* [Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool in Docker]()

### Downloading the Learning Lab Previewer

1. Browse to the public repository at https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse by clicking the link or entering the URL into your Web browser.  

* If requested, accept the security exception.  

* If you are prompted to log in, you've entered an incorrect URL.  Recheck the URL for typos and correct them. You do not need to log into Bitbucket to access this repository.

3. At the left side of the browser window, click **Download** and save the file to the __llp__ directory that you just created.

The  __learning-labs-previewer-master@_commitNumber_.zip__ downloads to your computer. This file  should be approximately 33 KB in size. As of this writing, the LLP download file is named learning-labs-previewer-master@5a101c897c8.zip, but a future version of this file might provide a different commit number.

* The user interface for saving this download varies according to your browser and your personal settings.

* If you see the "Bitbucket is queueing requests" warning, responses from the server may be slow. You may need to try your request more than once.

### Installing LLP on Windows 7
1. On your workstation, create the directory into which you will install the LLP tool, then set that directory as your working directory.

For example, the following commands create the `llp` directory at the root of the `C:` drive and then set `C:\llp` as the working directory.
```
cd \
mkdir llp
cd \llp
```

1. Move the __learning-labs-previewer-master@_commitNumber_.zip__ file to the `llp` folder that you created in the previous step.  

1. Using WinZip or another decompression tool, extract the __learning-labs-previewer-master@_commitNumber_.zip__ file into your `llp` directory.  The extracted fileset should look similar to the following figure.

2. Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).  
    1. Accept all suggested defaults in the install process.  
    1. After the installer completes, close your windows terminal and reopen it.
    1. Set your working directory to the `llp` folder you created.
    1. type `npm` and press the `Enter` key. You should see output like that shown in the following figure.

3. Determine whether `git` is installed on your system: in the command window, type `git --version` and press the __Enter__ key.

* If the response provides a `git` version number like the following example does, you're ready to use `git`:

```shell
C:\> git --version
git version 2.10.2.windows.1
```
* If the response does not provide a `git` version number, visit [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install `git`.

3. Clone and then install the [Angular JS generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) into your `llp` directory.
<br/>
  * In the command window, switch to the `llp` directory then type `git clone https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular` and press the __Enter__ key

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/yeoman_git.png)
<br/>
  * From your `llp` directory, install the Angular JS generator via the command window by typing `npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular` then pressing the __Enter__ key.

<br/>
4. From your llp directory,  install npm.
  * Type `npm install` then press the `Enter` key.

5. From your llp directory, install bower.
    * Type `bower install` then press the `Enter` key.

6. Download and install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org)
    * In the `Installation` window select the check boxes to add Ruby executable files to your PATH and to associate Ruby files with the installation.

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ruby_install.png)

    * After Ruby has been installed, take the following steps:
        * Close and reopen your windows terminal.
        * Switch to your `llp` directory.
        * Type `gem` and press the `Enter` key. You should see detail similar to that which the following figure shows.

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/gem.png)

7. Use the Ruby `gem` package installer to install the compass package:
  * In your windows terminal, access directory `llp` type `gem install compass` and press the `Enter` key. You should detail similar to that which appears in the following figure.

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/install_compass.png)

  * If you receive an SSL error during the installation this error is a known issue with Ruby.  There are several solutions to work around this issue such as [create a certificate](https://superdevresources.com/ssl-error-ruby-gems-windows/) which was utilized by our team, or temporarily [using http instead of https](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1736)
  ```
  ERROR: Could not find a valid gem 'compass' (>= 0), here is why:
    Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/
      - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B:
      certificate verify failed
```
8. In the `llp` directory, edit the `config.json` file to specify the local filesystem path to the labs to be previewed.
  * For example, the author's entry is: `{
 "labPath": "/users/brtiller/dev/devnet-learning-labs/devnet-guidelines/labs"
}`
  * If you prefer to use Windows directory format, the corresponding entry is:`{
 "labPath": "C:\\users\\brtiller\\dev\\devnet-learning-labs\\devnet-guidelines\\labs"
}`
**Note the double backslashes `(\\)` in the Windows-style pathname.** If your config.json does not escape Windows path separators in this way, `grunt` aborts with a warning like the following:

```
C:\llp> grunt serve
Loading "Gruntfile.js" tasks...ERROR
>> SyntaxError: C:\llp\config.json: Unexpected token p in JSON at position 15

jit-grunt: Plugin for the "serve" task not found.
```
9. On the command window access the llp directory and type `grunt serve`.  The following detail should appear.
  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/grunt_serve.png)
  * A browser window will open with contents displaying the labs under the specified directory that may be reviewed:

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/llp_view.png)

  * To preview a different location, exit grunt (ctrl+C), edit config.json, and then issue the `grunt serve` command again.<br/>
