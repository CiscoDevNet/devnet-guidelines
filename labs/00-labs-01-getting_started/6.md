## Step 6. Installing and Running Learning Lab Previewer Tool


The [Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) tool](https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse) displays how the lab content will appear on the production website. You can install this tool directly onto your computer.  If installing the previewer is not tenable, another option is to first install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview) which will function as a container on which you can install LLP.
> **Note:** It is possible to install Docker on Windows operating system (OS), but it has some requirements and bugs that prevent the LLP from working properly. For Windows users, as a temporary fix, we recommend to spin up a [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) on [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), and use it to run Docker Container


The LLP assists content developers view and fix lab formatting and content issues pushing it to the production. Ralph Schmieder created Dockerfile which containerizes the LLP application. For the instructions on how to install the LLP on Unix based operating system please refer to the [LLP's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/llp) and [video instructions](https://cisco.jiveon.com/videos/38761).
>**Note:** To create the docker image you will need to be VPNed in to Cisco's network. Alternatively, you can [download](https://cisco.box.com/s/05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b) the prebuild docker image and load it to your local repository by using `docker load < llp.tar` command.

As we stated before, Windows operating system has some requirements (must be Pro or higher version) and bugs which are preventing Docker from running properly on it. As a workaround we will show you how to install Docker on vitrual Ubuntu server, and run LLP on it.

1. Using Virtual Box create a new virtual machine (VM) with similar parameters and click start button to run it.

2. Complete the installation process using [official installation guide](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server/install-ubuntu-server).

3. After installation, is complete go back to Virtual Box's window and click on **Shared Folders** option

4. Click **Add new shared folder** button, then select **Auto-mount** and **Make Permanent** options. To share the folder click on the down arrow icon next to the **Folder Path** and select `Other...` option. Navigate to your working directory where **labs** folder is present and click **Select Folder button. In our case, the path to our working directory is `F:\Users\armartirosyan\LearningLabs`

  ![](/posts/files/getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_3.png)

5. Now, return to your ubuntu's console screen and **Devices** menu and select **Insert Guest Additions CD image...**

6. Next, authenticate to your machine and issue `sudo apt update` command

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_5.png)

7. After update process is complete, issue `sudo apt install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)` command to install all necessary dependencies.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_6.png)

8. Finally, issue `sudo mount /dev/cdrom/ /media/cdrom/ ; sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run; sudo reboot` command.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_7.png)

9. When machine comes back online, authenticate and issue `ls /media/sf_*` command. It should display the contents of your working directory in VM.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_8.png)

10. Now, we need to install docker, but first we need to update `apt` source list. To do that issue `$ sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates` command

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_9.png)

11. Then, using `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D` command add new GPG key

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_10.png)

12. Now, add new repository for `apt` search by issuing `echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list` command

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_11.png)

13. Finally, we can go ahead and install docker. Issue `sudo apt update ; sudo apt install -y linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual docker-engine; sudo service docker start` command.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_12.png)

14. After installation process is complete, we can proceed with downloading the docker image by issuing ` wget  https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b.tar` command.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_13.png)

15. Now we can load the docker image to docker's local repository. Use `sudo docker load < 05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b.tar` command

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_14.png)

16. To verify that image was successfully loaded, issue `sudo docker images` command

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_15.png)

17. Great! Finally we can start our LLP application. To do that issue `sudo docker run -p9000:9000 --name llp -v /media/sf_LearningLabs:/data -d my/llpreview` command. `/media/sf_LearningLabs` should be substituted with the folder name that was shared from your windows machine to the ubuntu VM.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_16.png)

18. To access the LLP application, we will need the IP address of the ubuntu VM. Issue `ifconfig` command and note the IP address associated with "physcial" interface. In our example it is `enp0s3`.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_17.png)

19. Now on your local windows machine, open your prefered web browser and point it to `http://{IP-OF-VM}:9000` URL address. In our case it is `http://192.168.0.16:9000`. If everything was done correctly, you should see **Learning Labs Previewer** web page and under the **lab** column you will find the lab that we have created during this tutorial. Click on the **Review** to see how LLP works.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/llp_1.png)

20. After you click the **Review** button, the contents of `1.md` file will be displayed. Verify that everything works and check next pages if you have them. Most important things to look for is missing images. As you can see the page is broken up into two section the upper section shows converted markdown file and lower section shows original code. It helps you to find and identify the issue in the code right away.
>**Note:** If you received and error after click **Review** button it means their is a syntax error in `.json` file. The error should point where the problem is.
