## Step 2: Setting up Your Working Directory and Files

### Setting up the Working Directory
The lab files you create will most likely be stored in a repository in Github that you will clone to your workstation.  The newly created directory on your workstation will probably be in a subdirectory that you've created.  For example, on my system in my brtiller directory I've created `dev\devnet-learning-labs` subdirectory.  From Github I've cloned the repository `devnet-express`. Each lab created resides in its own folder under the labs directory.  In this case I've created a lab directory which I've named `01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet`. As an aside the 01-intro-01 stands for `module 1 intro lab 1` followed by a brief lab title.

> **Note:** The labs directory must be the parent directory of all labs that are created in a repository as the publishing system will search for this parent directory when attempting to publish labs to production environment.

In the directory where your lab will reside, in this example `01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet`, create directories assets/images.  In the images directory place your image files which should be PNG format and 300 KB or lower in size.

### The Lab Files
Your lab files will be of four types:

* Markdown files (.md) that contain content written in markdown format.  These files will typically also contain html links to other web locations, and references to images stored in your assets/images directory. Each markdown file represents a page and a step in the lab and should be so ordered and named.  Page 1 should be named 1.md; page 2 should be named 2.md and so forth.<br/><br/>

* One JSON file which ties the lab together, provides a lab identification, title, tags and more. The JSON file must have the same name as your lab directory.  For example, in this lab the directory name is `01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet`, therefore the JSON file much be named `01-intro-01-intro-to-devnet.json`. More details to come.<br/><br/>

* One byod.html file that provides workstation set up information to the user. The content here typically explains what programming language such as Python, corresponding modules and other software needs to be set up along with how to do it. More details to come.<br/><br/>

* Image files in PNG format which are stored in the assets/images directory. These image files should be 300 kilobytes or smaller.
