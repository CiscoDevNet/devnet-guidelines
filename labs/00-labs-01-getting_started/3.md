## Step 3. Writing Content in Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language which helps to convert content written in plain text syntax into HTML. Markdown is heavily used in a lot of popular web sites where people discuss or share ideas. It also used to write content for Learning Labs.

For a general guideline on Markdown syntax checkout the [Markdown Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) posted on github.com. Please take a moment and review it. It covers almost everything that you might need during the content development.

Below is text formatted by Markdown followed by its corresponding syntax. This text represents typically formatting used in the learning labs.

1. # Specify the Lab Title Here on Page One

2. ## Step 3.  For Step Headings and other headings such as Objective and Prerequisites.

3. ### For sub Headings

4. #### For special sub headings such as: Next Step: Learn this next or Congratulations you've completed this lab!

5. Nothing needed for regular text

6. *Italicize Text using this*

7. **Bold text**

8. * Bullet points sometimes require indentation
   * Another bullet point

9. > Note: For special notes.

10. ` Special colorization `

11. For links [link text](https://www.cisco.com)

12. For images ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/test_image.png) where 00-labs-01-getting_started is the name of the directory in which your lab resides.

13. <br/><br/>For additional custom line breaks.

14. Shroud code blocks with three backticks on the start and end
``` python
var = "I'm learning Python!"
print (var)
```
<br/>
<br/>
