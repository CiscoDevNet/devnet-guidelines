## Step 8. Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool in Docker

Markdown previewers vary in their rendering capabilities as well as in their interpretations of various flavors of Markdown. To preview your lab content as it will appear on the DevNet site, you must install the __Learning Lab Previewer (LLP)__ tool on your computer.  To download and install the LLP tool inside a Docker container with Ubuntu as the operating system in a Virtual Box virtual machine, follow these instructions. To use a different environment, see either of the following:

* [Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool on Windows 7]()
* [Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool in Ubuntu]()

If your installation of the LLP tool on other platforms is unsuccessful, you can install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview), which provides a container in which to install the LLP tool.

> **Note:** Although it is possible to install Docker on the Windows operating system (OS), certain requirements (must be Pro or higher version) and bugs may prevent the LLP from working properly. As a workaround, we recommend that Windows users install Docker Container on a [Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) virtual machine that runs on [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

DevNet has created a Dockerfile that containerizes the LLP application. For instructions on how to install the LLP on a Unix-based operating system, see the [LLP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/llp) and [video instructions](https://cisco.jiveon.com/videos/38761).
>**Note:** To create the docker image you must be on a Cisco trusted network or you must establish a VPN connection to the Cisco network. Alternatively, you can [download the prebuilt docker image](https://cisco.box.com/s/05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b) and load it to your local repository by using the `docker load < llp.tar` command.

To use LLP in a Docker container that runs on an Ubuntu virtual machine, take the following steps:

1. Download the [Ubuntu Desktop ISO image](https://www.ubuntu.com/download).
    Be sure that you choose a "desktop" version, which provides the GNOME GUI and support for Web browsers that run in GNOME.
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) onto your workstation.
1. Download the VirtualBox Guest Additions for Ubuntu to your workstation for later use.

2. Use Virtual Box to create a new virtual machine (VM).
    1. In the __Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager__ window, click __New__.
	1. __Name and operating system__&ndash;Enter a name for your VM, choose __Linux__ as the __Type__ and choose __Ubuntu (64-bit)__ as the __Version__.  
	1. __Memory Size__&ndash;Allocate at least 1 GB of RAM
    1. __Hard Disk__&ndash;Choose __Create a Virtual Hard Disk Now__.
    1. __Hard Disk File Type__&ndash;Choose __VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)__.
    1. __Storage on Physical Hard Disk__&ndash;Choose __Dynamically Allocated__.
    1. __File Location and Size__&ndash;Allocate at least 11 GB storage to the virtual hard disk.
    1. Click __Create__.
        The new VM appears in the column on the left side of the __VirtualBox Manager__.
1. Attach the Ubuntu ISO and configure other VM settings:  
    1. Right click the new vm in the left column of __VirtualBox Manager__ and choose __Settings...__
        * On the __System__ tab, deselect __Floppy__.
        * On the __Storage__ tab, select __Empty__ under __Controller:IDE__ then click the optical disk icon.
            ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/choose_iso_icon.png)
        * Select __Choose Virtual Optical Disk file...__, select the Ubuntu ISO, and click __Open__.
        * On the Network tab choose Bridged Adapter.
        * Click OK.
1. Install Ubuntu into the VM
	1. Select your new VM in __Virtual Box Manager__ and click __Start__.  

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_1.png)

<!-- maybe you dont have to choose the iso while setting up the vm?
	* At the OS prompt select the Ubuntu ISO image.
-->
    1. Click __Install Ubuntu__ to install Ubuntu from the ISO onto the VM's virtual hard disk.
        * Deselect __Download updates__ and deselect __install third party software__ before clicking __Continue__.
        * Select __Erase disk and install ubuntu__. In this context, this option refers to the virtual disk; it won't erase the hard disk of the host machine!
        * Respond to the install prompts using default values except when the default value will not allow you to proceed further.
            When an operation is destructive,  the Ubuntu installer makes you choose it intentionally. For example, you must intentionally choose the option that actually installs the OS, overwriting whatever might be on the target disk.

    Here's more detail about [installing Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop) .

4. Add the lab directory that contain your labs as a shared folder that the VM can access.  
	1. In VirtualBox, choose __Settings...>Shared Folders__.

  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_2.png)

	1. Click the **Add new shared folder** icon.
  ![](/posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_add_shared_folder.png)
  <br/>
  1. Click the down-arrow icon next to **Folder Path** and select __Other__.
  2. Navigate to the PARENT of the **labs** folder in your local repository and click __Open__
    <!-- Does this need to go to the PARENT of labs ? so that labs is visible to the publishing system ? -->
  3. Optionally, enter a different name for your shared folder by typing it into the the **Folder Name** field.
     **Note:** Virtual Box prefixes **sf_** to the name that you enter in the **Folder Name** field. For example, if you create a shared folder named MyFolder, it appears in the Ubuntu VM as /media/sf_MyFolder.
  1. Select the __Auto Mount__ and __Make Permanent__ checkboxes, then click __OK__.  
     **Note:** on some Virtual Box platforms, you may need to click __OK__ in two dialog boxes.
  <br/>

6. In order for your VM to access the shared folder, you need to install the VirtualBox guest additions:
<!-- I had problems with shared folders; still troubleshooting. May be better to skip this and use the CLI instructions -->
    * In Virtual Box, choose __Devices>Insert Guest Additions CD image...__.  
        At the prompt, confirm your intention to install the VirtualBox guest additions and supply your password.
    * If instead of an installation prompt, an error message says that the __GuestAdditions.iso__ cannot be mounted, take the following steps:
        1. Shut down your virtual machine.
        1. In __Virtual Box Manager__, select the VM, then choose __Machine>Settings...__
        1. On the __Storage__ tab, select __VBoxGuestAdditions.iso__ under __Controller:IDE__ then click the optical disk icon.
        1. Choose the ISO that you used to install Ubuntu; for example, __ubuntu-16.04.1-server-amd64.iso__.
        1. Click the optical disk icon again and choose __Remove Disk From Virtual Drive__.
        1. Click OK, start the VM and log in.
        1. Choose __Devices>Insert Guest Additions CD image...__.
            This time around, you should see the prompt to install guest additions. The cryptic error message you saw earlier was complaining that the
            Ubuntu installation virtual disc was still in your virtual drive, preventing you from putting the Guest Additions installation disc into that same drive, just as if you had left a physical disc in a physical drive.

7. Restart your VM, open a terminal window, and issue the `sudo apt update` command.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_5.png)

8. After the update completes, issue `sudo apt install -y dkms build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-$(uname -r)` command to install all necessary dependencies.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_6.png)

9. Finally, issue `sudo mount /dev/sr0/ /media/cdrom/ ; sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run; sudo reboot` command.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_7.png)

10. When the machine comes back online, authenticate and issue `ls /media/sf_*` command. It should display the contents of your working directory in the  VM.  
<!-- I recall a lot of screwing around to get this to work. Had to add a command to .bash_profile or something. That was actually on a
different Ubuntu VM, but if the step is missing, or if sharing does not work upon rebooting the VM, look in a previous ubuntu
LL setup file for that step. e.g. it might be in 7.md in this lab // jp -->
  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_8.png)

    * If the `labs` folder does not appear in this listing, correct your shared folder settings.
    * If you cannot access the shared content, take the following steps:
        1. Add your username to the vboxsf group:
            `sudo adduser `_yourusername_` vboxsf`
        1. Reboot the VM
        1. Recheck your access to the shared folder by issuing `ls /media/sf_*`  or by using your graphical desktop environment to look inside the `Computer/Media/sf_labs` folder.

<!-- at this point can we unmount the VBOXADDITIONS cd-rom? otherwise it always gets mounted (from my shared mac folder) -->

11. Before attempting to install Docker, update the `apt` source list by issuing the following command in the terminal window:
    `$ sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates`

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_9.png)

12. To add a new GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) key, issue the following command in the terminal window:
   `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D`

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_10.png)

13. To add a new repository for `apt` search, issue the following command in your terminal window:
    `echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list`

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_11.png)

14. Now you are ready to install Docker. To do so, issue the following command in your terminal window:
    `sudo apt update ; sudo apt install -y linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual docker-engine; sudo service docker start`
  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_12.png)

15. After the installation process completes, download the Docker image to your home directory by issuing the following command:
    `wget  https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b.tar`
<!-- you might need anyconnect for this: download from https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/anyconnect/
install guide https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/Docs/VPN_Access/AnyConnect_Installation_Guide.pdf
you will need this info too https://technicalsanctuary.wordpress.com/2016/05/28/installing-cisco-anyconnect-vpn-on-ubuntu-16-04/
It appears you can just use wget or curl for the actual download, but you need the VPN connection to reach the box server
Not sure whether that is true, either. I killed the VPN connection and actually did resolve cisco.box.com and began downloading from
the stock ubuntu install without a vpn connection. IDK whether the download would complete or verify without that. Ask Armen.
In the meantime, I went ahead and used the docker image that I had previously downloaded for a previous version of these instructions.
wget is not a native tool on mac os. curl syntax is tricky. To do this on mac, execute
curl -L -o 'your_name_for_tarfile.tar' 'https://cisco.box.com/shared/static/05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b.tar'
the -L follows redirects and the -o writes to a file instead of to the screen; note that the order of the paths is different on mac!aaaargh
article that solved my curl problem on mac is https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/mac-os-x-terminal-download-file/
-->
  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_13.png)

16. To load the docker image to docker's local repository, issue the following command:
    `sudo docker load < 05kjlvobv2jf3lz23ozz9gg66cfdcs3b.tar`
<!-- assumes you did not rename the file, which may have been the case if you used curl or some other tool-->

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_14.png)

17. To verify that image was loaded successfully, issue the `sudo docker images` command; it should produce a listing like the following:

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_15.png)

11. In your home directory create a `config.json` file that specifies the local filesystem path to the labs to be previewed.
    <!-- jwp to do: if I get this thing working, update this path to /media/sf_LearningLabs"
    For example, if your labs are in the  `/media/sf_labs/` folder, create a file named `config.json` that contains the following:
    `{"labPath":"/media/sf_labs/"}`

    To create this file from the terminal window, issue the following command:
    `echo '{"labPath":"/media/sf_labs/"}' > config.json`

    <!-- NOW is a good time to back up your machine or your VM because I've yet to recover successfully from a mistake in the next step!!!! -->

18. You are now ready to start the Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) application.

<!-- unfortunately there is a critical error in the original learning lab or the docker image. When I start the llp with incorrect syntax as below, it runs but it looks in the wrong place (/data/labs). Creating /data/labs does not help.

sudo docker run -p9000:9000 --name llp -v /media/sf_LearningLabs:/data -d cisco/llp

This seems to mean that i should share the parent (so that labs/ appears in the bound volume) and maybe name the mount point for the shared folder sf_LearningLabs (for now at least). if that works, then i can see whether config.json even matters (it seems not to, as it has an incorrect path now that does not appear in the LLP). Another thing to try is just skipping the shared volume and putting labs somewhere locally till I can get that working, then revisit the shared folder

-->

    <div>
    **IMPORTANT**
    Before issuing the following command **CHECK the value of _pathToYourLabs_ CAREFULLY!** If it is incorrect, recovery may not be trivial. In particular, the directory name MUST end with a forward slash (/\).
    <div>

    To start the LLP tool, issue the following command:
    `sudo docker run -p9000:9000 --name llp -v` _pathToYourLabs_`:/data -d cisco/llp`

    For example, if `/media/sf_labs/` is the path to the folder that your host machine shared with the ubuntu VM, then this command would be as follows; if you shared a different folder, update the path appropriately:

    `sudo docker run -p9000:9000 --name llp -v /media/sf_labs/:/data -d cisco/llp`


<!-- at least, that's how things went for me. I need to follow up with Armen. My experience was that any mistakes in this command are the kiss of death. The point of no return. Even uninstalling and reinstalling docker does not solve it. I did manage to get the LLP running (but not showing any labs) the first time I did this, so I know that these directions are close to correct but not quite there.  We should include a recovery procedure for mistakes in this command, because it is not realistic to expect people to reinstall docker. I happened to have saved off a VM that had most of the work done so it wasn't too bad, but it was still more fooling around than should be required for one typo.-->

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_16.png)

19. To access the LLP application, you need the IP address of the ubuntu VM. Issue `ifconfig` command and note the inet addr value associated with the physical Ethernet interface. For example, in the following figure, this interface is `enp0s3` and `192.168.0.16` is its IP address.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/ubuntu_17.png)

20. On the machine that hosts Docker (for example, your Windows machine, or the Ubuntu VM into which you installed Docker), use your preferred Web browser to view port 9000 at the IP address you identified in the previous step. For example, in the following figure, the URL to browse is `http://192.168.0.16:9000`. If everything is working correctly, you should see the **Learning Labs Previewer** web page; under the **lab** column, you will find the lab that you created during this tutorial. Click **Preview** to view the LLP rendition of this content.

  ![](posts/files/00-labs-01-getting_started/assets/images/llp_1.png)

<!-- THE FOLLOWING HIDDEN BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE IT'S TRUE. There was no config.json file in my llp, and IDK whether it's because i forgot to create it or for some other reason. Creating one did not enable LLP to find my labs, possibly because I used the wrong path when starting up LLP in Docker.

If you don't see the labs, you probably specified the path incorrectly in your `config.json` file. Revise the path then reload the browser page the displays the previewer. If you need to restart the previewer, use the following command:
    `sudo docker restart llp`

-->

21. After you click the **Preview** button, the contents of `1.md` file will be displayed. Verify that everything works and check next pages if you have them. The most important things to look for is missing images. As you can see the page is broken up into two sections; the upper section shows converted markdown file and the lower section shows original code. This feature helps you to find and identify the issue in the code right away.
>**Note:** If you received an error after click **Preview** button it means there is a syntax error in the `.json` file. The error should point where the problem is.
