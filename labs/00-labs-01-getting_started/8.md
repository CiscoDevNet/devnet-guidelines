# Step 8: Maintaining Learning Labs

Once a lab has been created and is in production, you will probably need to go back and update it from time to time.    

## Editing a lab
If you need to edit an existing lab, you will need to first ensure that your local repository is up-to-date. You may then make changes and add those changes to the production repository.

Refer to [A Brief Introduction to Git](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/fundamentals/git-basic-workflows/step/1) for more information about Git workflows.

## Creating a redirect

Sometimes when a lab is retired, you will need to ensure that its URL directs users to the content that replaces it. For this process, you will add a redirect to the JSON file for the lab.  

1. Open the JSON file and ensure the lab is set to `active:true`.
2. Add a line of code to the end of the JSON file, inside the closing square bracket:
  ```
  "redirectTo": "git-basic-workflows",
  ```
3. Save the JSON file, commit your changes, and merge the change into the production repository.

**Congratulations! You've completed the getting started lab!**

Happy writing!
