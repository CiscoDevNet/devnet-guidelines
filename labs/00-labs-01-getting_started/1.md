# Writing Learning Labs

This lab shows you how to create a DevNet Learning Lab.

## Objectives ##

Completion Time: 45 minutes

* Understand the structure of a DevNet Learning Lab
* Learn how to set up your working directory and its contents
* Understand basic Markdown syntax
* Understand how to provide byod.html content that tells users how to set up their own devices for use with your lab
* Understand how to use the JSON file to organize and present lab content
* Set up and use the Learning Lab Previewer Tool
* Begin writing your own Learning Lab


## Prerequisites

To write a DevNet Learning Lab, you'll need a basic understanding of `git` workflows. Optionally, you can [install a local git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), a repository browser (such as [Atlassian SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)) and a specialized markdown editor (such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

* Basic Understanding of Git (Required)
If you are not already familiar with the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version-control system, see the [Git Learning Lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/git-intro/step/1) or the [ProGit](https://progit.org/) free, online book.

* Local Git Client (Recommended)
Although the DevNet `git` repository provides a Web-based GUI, installing a `git` client on your own workstation will simplify the management of your repository-based content by allowing you to use the command line on your local workstation or a GUI client such as [Atlassian SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to interact with the DevNet repository. For more information, see How to Set Up Your Own Computer.

* Markdown Editor (Recommended)
You can write a DevNet Learning Lab entirely in the Web-based GUI to the DevNet repository or you can use any text editor that you prefer. However, a specialized Markdown editor can simplify the job. We recommend the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) because it provides syntax highlighting for Markdown, JSON and HTML, as well as an interactive Markdown Previewer and other handy features.
<!--
It's a good idea to associate your markdown files such as 1.md with your markdown editor to make file access easier.

## Step 1. Understanding the Structure of Learning Labs
To help users learn more easily, all Learning Labs provide a consistent structure and format. To make it easier for other DevNet members to contribute to Learning Lab projects, all files in the repository observe certain conventions for naming and placement.

### Specifying Objectives and Prerequisites
The first page of every learning lab begins with an __Objectives__ section, followed immediately by a __Prerequisites__ section.
  *  **Objective**&ndash;The first line of this section specifies the estimated amount of time to complete the lab. Subsequent bullet points list each main skill that the user should posess, task that the user should complete, or idea that the user should understand upon completion of the lab.
  * **Prerequisites**&ndash;This section describes basic knowledge that the user should have prior to attempting to complete this lab. Whenever possible, provide links to relevant labs or other resources that may help the user to fulfill the prerequisites. This section may also list tools that the lab requires, but it should not provide setup instructions; those go in the byod.html file.

### Structure of Content Files

Each page in the end-user navigable lab corresponds to a single markdown file in the repository; thus, this document may refer to an individual markdown file as a page.  To ensure a consistent experience for the end-user, each page observes the following conventions.

* **One main step per page**
Each page provides only one main activity. This activity is formatted as a top-level headline of the form "Step *N*:*step_description*", in which *N* corresponds to the page number. For example, page 1 would contain Step 1, formatted as the largest headline; page 2 would contain Step 2, and so forth.  The page can contain additional subheads, but the largest headline must be of the form Step *N*: *step_description*.

  <br/>
  <br/>

*  **Numeric filenames correspond to order of presentation**
Each markdown file must have a numeric name that indicates its order in the end-user presentation of the lab.  For example, page 1 is named `1.md`, page 2 is named `2.md` and so on.

  <br/>
  <br/>  

* **Image file specification**
Your image files must meet the following specifications:

    * Images must be in PNG format and they must be 300 KB or less in size.  Larger image files take too long to encode, which slows production!
    * Under your lab directory, create an assets/images subdirectory and store images there.
    * **Image names must be all lowercase**.

        <br/>
        <br/>  

* **Markdown syntax for adding images to the page**
Images should be added to a page in the following manner: `![](/posts/files/04-rest-04-learning-python-json/assets/images/your_image.png)` where `04-rest-04-learning-python-json` is the lab directory containing subdirectory assets/images and the PNG file is your_image.png
  * The image will not be viewable in your markdown editor; however, it will be viewable in the Learning Lab Previewer tool as well as the in the Production environment where the labs reside for public use.
5.  The **byod.html** known as bring-your-own-device should always contain text providing guidelines for users who want to set up their own devices to interface with the lab.  More detail will be provided later in this lab.<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>  
6. The **JSON file** must have the same name as the directory that houses the lab.  For example, if the directory is 04-rest-04-learning-python-json the json file must be so named 04-rest-04-learning-python-json.json .  Note that the naming scheme 04-rest-04 stands for module 4 rest lab 4. More detail will be provided later in this lab.<br/><br/>

<br/>
<br/>  
7. Using the Learning Lab Previewer tool is essential as it provides a view into how the lab will appear in the production environment.  **All learning labs writers must preview their work with the Learning Lab Previewer tool and make corrections before requesting publishing.**<br/><br/>
