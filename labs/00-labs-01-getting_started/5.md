## Step 5. Bind Everything together with the JSON File

JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner. See [JSON: What It Is, How It Works, & How to Use It by Jason Lengstorf](https://www.copterlabs.com/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/). The code that generates the Learning Labs, reads the JSON file and knows how many `.md` files are in the lab, what tags should be associated with it, and if `byod.html` is used. In this step we will show you what goes inside that file.

1. The name of the JSON file has to be the same as the folder's name with `.json` at the end. For example, if the directory is `04-rest-02-spark-rest-api-and-postman` the json file must be so named `04-rest-02-spark-rest-api-and-postman.json`.

2. An example of a json file is below. Beneath the code snippet is the explanation of each key and what should the value be for that key.
```
{
  "labId": "00-labs-01-getting_started",
  "title": "Getting Started with Writing Learning Labs",
  "slug": "Learn about how to write DevNet learning labs.",
  "time": 45,
  "byod": true,
  "files": [
    {"title": "1.md"},
    {"title": "2.md"},
    {"title": "3.md"},
    {"title": "4.md"},
    {"title": "5.md"},
    {"title": "6.md"},
    {"title": "7.md"}
  ],
  "tags": [
	{"title": "DevNet Lab Template"}
  ],
  "related": [
    {      
	  "labId": "01-intro-02-overview-of-modules",
	  "title": "Overview of Modules in This Track"
    }
  ],      
  "authors": [
      {"name": "Armen Martirosyan", "email": "armartir@cisco.com"}
  ],
  "active": true
}
```
  * `labId` - The value identifies the lab's ID which must be unique. It is typically given the folder's name under which the `.json` file is located.
  > **Note**: If your lab has previously been published it is recommended that you do not change the lab ID. If you do change the ID, you must inform the publisher of this change; otherwise this ID change will result in labs being duplicated in the production environment.
  * `title` - Title of the lab.  The title will appear in the lab listings.
  * `slug` - A brief description about the lab's goals which will appear with the lab title.
  * `time` - Estimated time it will take the user to complete the lab. Typically 15 to 45 minutes.
  * `byod` - If `byod.html` file is present then the vlaue should be `true`, otherwise it should be `false`.  This value should always be `true` and the byod.html file always be present unless the lab cannot be completed except under special circumstances.
  * `files` - This key holds a list of markdown files that are present in the lab directory.
  * `tags` - tags help to identify how users can find the lab via the navigation bar which displays all tags.  Please note that tags are case sensitive.
  * `related` - All other labs that are related to this lab should be identified in this list. You will need to provide related lab's ID and the title.
  * `authors` - authors' name and email may be provided here.
  * `active` - To have the lab become viewable for user access set the value to `true`, otherwise set to `false`.

3. Validate the JSON by cutting and pasting your text into a JSON validator such as [http://jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com) .  Make all needed corrections.  
> **Note:** A JSON file that has an invalid format or incorrectly named will be ignored causing markdown pages and tags to be ignored by the publisher.
