<p>Although the DevNet git repository provides a Web-based GUI, installing a <code>git</code> client on your own workstation will simplify the management of your repository-based content. You can then nteract with the DevNet repository from the command line on your local workstation or from within a GUI-based repository browser, such as <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian SourceTree</a></p>

<p>Many modern operating systems provide a pre-installed <code>git</code> client; to see whether <code>git</code> is already installed on your OS, open a terminal window and type <code>git --version</code> at the command prompt; if the response provides a <code>git</code> version number, you're ready to use <code>git</code>:</p>

<p><code$ git version 2.9.3 (Apple Git-75)</code></p>

<p>If the response does not provide a <code>git</code> version number, <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">visit this page to install git</a>.</p>

<p> After verifying that <code>git</code> is installed and running on your workstation, you might want to install <a="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com">Atlassian SourceTree</a>, too. </p>
