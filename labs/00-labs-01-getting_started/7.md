## Step 7. Writing Learning Labs - The Next Step

Now that you've learned the concepts and practice of writing a learning lab we suggest that you use one of our provided templates to get started.  

#### Steps to get Started
1. Create your own git repository in Github for the learning labs that you will create and clone this repository to your workstation.

2. Clone the git repository https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-guidelines by entering on your terminal the command `git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-guidelines.git`

3. In the labs directory locate a template folder such as 00-labs-02-basic_template

4. Copy this folder into your labs directory of your repository files on your workstation.

5. Rename the directory to something that fits your lab title, open the file 1.md and begin editing the file.

6. Refer to this lab as needed for guidelines.
