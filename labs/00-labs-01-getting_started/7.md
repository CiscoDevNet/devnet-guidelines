## Step 7. Installing and Running the Learning Lab Previewer Tool on Linux


This step provides guidelines to install the Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) tool into a Linux Operating System. These instructions were written using Ubuntu 16.10.  If you are using a Windows environment skip this step and go to Step 6.  If you are not able to install the LLP on your OS, there is a workaround provided in Step 8 with Docker.

The [Learning Lab Previewer (LLP) tool](https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse) displays how the lab content will appear on the production website. You can install this tool directly onto your computer.  The steps below will show how to download and install the LLP tool into a Windows OS.

### Downloading the Learning Lab Previewer
1. On your workstation create a directory for which you will install the LLP, then access the directory.  Here the author is creating the user specific directory as `llp`.
   *  cd /home/brett
   * mkdir llp
   * cd llp

2. Access the public repository https://stash-eng.cisco.com/bitbucket/projects/DLL/repos/learning-labs-previewer/browse by entering the URL into your browser.  There is no need to log into Bitbucket to access the repository.  If requested accept the security exception so that you may access the web site.  If you are prompted to login you've entered an incorrect URL for the repository.  Recheck the URL for typos and correct them.

3. In the web browser screen there are two action links located in the left navigation panel.  Click on the **Download** link.  A pop up window will appear.  Save the zipped file into your `llp` directory.

### LLP Installation Steps on Ubuntu
1. Using a linux decompression tool such as `unzip` extract the LLP files into your llp directory.  Your files should appear as shown below.

2. We'll use the debian package manager `apt-get` to [install Nodejs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04).  Here's a little more information about [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) .
  * To install Nodejs on Ubuntu open a terminal then enter the following commands one at a time and press the `Enter` key after each command.  Provide the requested sudo password. Accept all requests.
    * sudo apt-get update
    * sudo apt-get install nodejs
    * sudo apt-get install npm
  * Once NodeJS has been installed type `npm` and press the `Enter` key. You should see similar detail shown below.

3. Install the NodeJs-legacy
  * Type: `sudo apt install nodejs-legacy`

4. Clone and then install the [Angular JS generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) into your `llp` directory.
<br/>
  * In the command window access the `llp` directory then type: `git clone https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular`
    > **Note:** If you haven't installed `git` on your system install it now.  In the Ubuntu terminal enter the command `sudo apt install git`.  Once installed use `git` to clone the repository.

5. From your llp directory now install Angular JS generator
  * Type: `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower yo generator-karma generator-angular`

6. From your llp directory now install npm.
  * Type `npm install`

7. From your llp directory now install bower.
    * Type `bower install`

8. install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org)
    * Type `sudo apt-get install ruby`
    * Accept the installation requests    
    * Once Ruby has been installed access the `llp` directory type `gem`. You should see similar detail shown below.

9. Install the Ruby development tools
    * Type `sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`
    * Accept the installation requests    

10. Install the compass package using the Ruby gem package installer
  * Access directory `llp` type `sudo gem install compass`. You should see similar detail shown below.

11. In the `llp` directory edit the `config.json` file and specify the path where the labs to be reviewed are placed.
  * For example, the author's entry is: {
 "labPath": "/home/brett/dev/devnet-guidelines/labs/"}

12. On the command window access the llp directory and type `grunt serve`.  The following detail should appear.

  * A browser window will open with contents displaying the labs under the specified directory that may be reviewed:
