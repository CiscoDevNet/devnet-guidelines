# Writing Learning Labs

This lab shows you how to create a DevNet Learning Lab.    

## Objectives

* Understand the structure of a DevNet Learning Lab
* Learn how to set up your working directory and its contents
* Understand basic Markdown syntax
* Understand how to provide `byod.html` content that tells users how to set up their own devices for use with your lab
* Understand how to use the JSON file to organize and present lab content
* Set up and use the Learning Lab Previewer Tool
* Begin writing your own Learning Lab

## Prerequisites

To write a DevNet Learning Lab, you'll need a basic understanding of `git` workflows. Optionally, you can [install a local git client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), a repository browser (such as [Atlassian SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)) and a specialized Markdown editor (such as [Atom](https://atom.io/)).

* **Basic understanding of Git (Required)**

	If you are not already familiar with the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version-control system, see the [Git Learning Lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/lab/git-intro/step/1) or the [ProGit](https://progit.org/) book (free download or purchase paperback).

* **Local Git client (Recommended)**

	Although the DevNet `git` repository provides a Web-based GUI, installing a `git` client on your own workstation will simplify the management of your repository-based content by allowing you to use the command line on your local workstation or a GUI client such as [Atlassian SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) to interact with the DevNet repository. For more information, see How to Set Up Your Own Computer.

* **Markdown editor (Recommended)**

	You can write a DevNet Learning Lab entirely in the Web-based GUI to the DevNet repository or you can use any text editor that you prefer. However, a specialized Markdown editor can simplify the job. We recommend the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) because it provides syntax highlighting for Markdown, JSON and HTML, as well as an interactive Markdown previewer and other handy features.
