## Step 4. The byod.html file: Helping Users Bring Their own Device

The BYOD in the byod.html file stands for `Bring Your Own Device` which refers to a device that a person can bring, set up and use to accomplish a task. While DevNet provides [sandboxes](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) that users can freely reserve and use to complete most of the learning labs, people who want to complete the labs on their own computer may need to install required software before starting certain labs. That is where `byod.html` file comes into play as it describes all of the software required along with how to obtain it with additional detail where needed.

1. As you've already guessed, we need to start by creating a file named `byod.html`.  

2. This byod.html file is written using [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and typically has the format below.
>**Note:** The `byod.html` file always starts and ends with `<div> </div>` tags. If you are not familiar with HTML tags refer to this [website](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
<br/>
```html
<div>
	<h3>This is a header</h3>
	<p> This is a paragraph </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bulleted List 1</li>
		<li>Bulleted List 2</li>
		<li>Bulleted List 3</li>
	</ul>
	To use a hyperlink click <a href=https://www.cisco.com>here</a>
</div>
```
<br/>
Explanation:
  * `<div> </div>` - Defines a division or a section in an HTML document and is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS. byod.html always starts and ends with this tag.
  * `<h3> </h3>` - Indicates the heading size. The lower the number the bigger the letters.
  * `<p> </p>` - Defines a paragraph.
  * `<ul> </ul>` - Used to create unordered bulleted list.
  * `<li> </li>` - Creates an item in the list.
  * `<a href="URL">HYPERLINK TEXT</a>` - Creates a hyperlink.
<br/>
<br/>

<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>You can edit this html file in your own editor such as Atom and view it in your html supported editor or a web browser.
<br/><br/>
<li>A published learning lab will contain a link at the top of every page named "How to Setup Your Own Computer".  When the user clicks on this link the window will open and display the content of the byod.html file in html format.
</ol>
