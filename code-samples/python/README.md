# Python Code Templates
_Templates for creating Python sample code for Cisco Learning Labs_


## Structuring Your Sample Code Repository

> _Goal:_ Make working with your sample code as easy as possible.

You should structure your sample code respository as follows:
```
.
├── README.md
├── env_lab.py
├── env_user.py
├── env_user.template
├── module-slug
│   └── lab-slug
│       └── example.py
└── requirements.txt
```

_Explanation:_

* **README.md** - Bare Minimum Documentation.  #AlwaysDoThis

* **[env_lab.py](./env_lab.py)** - Lab Environment "Python" environment variables file.

* **[env_user.template](./env_user.template)** - User Info "Python" environment file template.

* **module_slug** - The short-name slug for your module(s) _- all lower case, no spaces, underscores as needed for seperation_.

* **lab_slug** - The short-name slug for your labs(s) _- all lower case, no spaces, underscores as needed for seperation_.

* **[example.py](./example.py)** - Your sample code files.  See the provided `example.py` file for examples of how to import and use the lab and user Python environment files.

* **[requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)** - The consolidated list of packages that your labs depend-upon.  Typically generated by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` from within your virtual environment.
