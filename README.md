# DevNet Writing Guidelines (Public)

Welcome to the guidelines on DevNet writing processes and standards. 

This repo contains guidelines on creating labs, code samples, slides and setting up sandboxes.

## Learning Lab Templates

The learning lab templates and code samples templates should only be published to and accessed from the [Staged](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867) environment.  They should not be published to production.

# Code Conventions

See the [wiki](CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki) for the style guide on DevNet coding conventions.


# Python Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains python scripts that might be useful when authoring. The scripts are not required to author labs. 

For example, the `create_new_lab.py` script creates the directory structure and copies the template files that you need to create a new lab. Alternatively, you could do the same thing manually.
