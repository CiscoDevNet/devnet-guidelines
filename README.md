Instructions and guidelines on how to: 

  - create DevNet labs
  - edit existing labs
  - publish labs
  - create and publish code samples

These instructional labs and templates should only be published to and accessed from the [Staged](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867) environment.  They should not be published to production.

# Python Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains python scripts that might be useful when authoring. The scripts are not required to author labs. 

For example, the `create_new_lab.py` script creates the directory structure and copies the template files that you need to create a new lab. Alternatively, you could do the same thing manually.
